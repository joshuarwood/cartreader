# cartreader
Catridge reader project inspired by Sanni cart reader but with simplifications to reduce the number of components / code needed. Focuses purely on cartidge dumping. Does not handle save game info.

# Requirements
You'll need an Arduino Mega board, a couple of USB cables, a PC, and some soldering skills. N64 cartridges also require an external +3.3V power supply.
